🐳 Docker for DevOps
This folder contains essential Docker topics and practice shell scripts required for containerization in DevOps workflows. Each script demonstrates a core Docker concept frequently used in real-world projects including container lifecycle, image management, networking, volumes, multi-container apps, and security scanning.

📚 Topics Covered
01–04. Docker Basics
Container lifecycle commands (docker run, docker ps, docker stop, docker rm)

Image management (docker pull, docker images, docker rmi)

Container networking basics

Dockerfile creation and image building

Docker volumes and persistent storage

05–08. Intermediate Docker
Docker networks (bridge, host)

Docker logs and stats monitoring

Docker exec for running commands inside containers

Environment variables and ports mapping

09–12. Dockerfile Best Practices
Writing optimized Dockerfiles

Layer caching and multi-stage builds

Image tagging and pushing to Docker Hub

13–16. Docker Compose
Running multi-container applications locally

Compose YAML syntax and commands

Service dependencies and environment files

17–20. Docker Security & Maintenance
Managing container users and permissions

Image scanning basics

Clean-up scripts for dangling images and volumes

21. Docker Compose Basics
Simple multi-service application setup using Docker Compose

22. Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes
Comparison of container orchestration tools

Use cases and industry trends

23. Docker Image Scan with Trivy
Using Trivy to detect vulnerabilities in Docker images

24. Docker Monitoring Basics
Viewing container logs, resource usage, and process information

🧪 How to Run Scripts

chmod +x 21-docker-compose-basics.sh
./21-docker-compose-basics.sh

# or

bash 21-docker-compose-basics.sh
You can run any script similarly after making it executable.
